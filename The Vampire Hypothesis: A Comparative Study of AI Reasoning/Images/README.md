### Image Naming Convention

All image files within this directory follow a consistent two-digit naming convention:

`AI_PN_SN.png`

Where:

* **'AI'**: Represents the **AI Agent**
* **`PN`**: Represents the **Prompt Number**. This refers to the sequential number of the prompt (your input) in the dialogue history that the screenshot is associated with.
* **`SN`**: Represents the **Screenshot Number**. This indicates the sequential number of the screenshot taken *within that specific prompt's response*.

**Example:**

* `Grok_01_01.png`: The first screenshot taken from the response to the first prompt to Grok.
* `Claude_05_02.png`: The second screenshot taken from the response to the fifth prompt to Claude.

This naming system ensures clear traceability and easy navigation through the discussion, allowing viewers to follow the evolution of ideas and solutions as they were generated during the AI training process.
